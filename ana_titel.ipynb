The            Institute of Epigenetics and Stem Cells (IES)            is looking for a highly motivated Postdoc interested in investigating repetitive elements in the control of cell identity. Fertilisation of an oocyte by the sperm results in the generation of a totipotent zygote, which has the inherent ability to form a new organism. This is followed by epigenetic reprogramming of both parental genomes, which includes heterochromatin formation and activation of repetitive elements. The functional significance of this is largely not understood, yet, recent evidence indicates that this remodelling underlies cellular plasticity. Importantly, repetitive elements are often found misregulated in degenerative diseases, during ageing or in cancer. Thus, understanding their biological relevance is of fundamental importance.

Unser Profil RWTH Aachen University is one of the most renowned technical universities of Europe and has recently successfully renewed its position as German University of Excellence. The Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering WZL is among the largest and leading institutes in the domain of production technology. Within this framework, the Chair of Production Metrology and Quality Management &amp;amp; Information Management in Mechanical Engineering  held by Prof. Dr.Ing. Robert H. Schmitt conducts research on datadriven approaches to sensing, automation, process control, quality management, sustainability and organisational development. The research group Industrial Tomography and the team of WZL's measuring room work on further innovation in industrial Xray Computed Tomography (xCT) and its application in highly relevant industry sectors, e.g. battery production or additive manufacturing. The high extent of academic and industrial collaboration in this field over the recent years manifests the research group's expertise. About the Project xCTing Firsttimeright and zerodefect manufacturing of customized lotsizeone products are essential elements of the Industry 4.0 paradigm shift to reinforce Europe's global leadership in manufacturing. Xray Computed Tomography (CT) metrology has a key role to play in this transition, since it is the only known technology that can certify nondestructively the quality of internal complex structures, such as those produced by additive manufacturing or found in assemblies. However, CT largely remains an offline technology, due to the unsolved tradeoff between scan speed and scan quality, and the need for extensive expert user input. xCTing will therefore focus on significantly increasing autonomy, robustness and speed in CT metrology in order to support its transition towards a fully inline quality assurance technology as required in Industry 4.0 environments. Meeting these challenges requires the integration of a broad range of interdisciplinary expertise, including physics, manufacturing, dimensional metrology, machine learning, as well as efficient and reliable big data analytics and visualization. In order to achieve the envisaged innovation breakthrough in the European industry, Europe is in dire need of innovators who can combine this variety of competences with entrepreneurial skills. The xCTing project is a panEuropean industrialacademic initiative committed to provide the unique and encompassing training environment required to foster this new generation of innovationminded research engineers, that will act as catalysts in the further transformation of Europe's manufacturing industry towards global technological leadership. The overall aim of the xCTing project is to train 15 promising researchers (ESRs) that will take the lead in conceiving the next generation of European Industry 4.0ready CT technology. The xCTing consortium consists of 9 beneficiaries and 6 partner organisations. xCTing is a European Marie SklodowskaCurie Innovative Training Network, funded by the European Union within the Horizon 2020 framework.

The main objective is to develop a model to automatically optimize exposure parameters to reduce dimensional measurement uncertainty and increase defect detection probability. In function of dimensional measurement uncertainty, defect detection probability and region of interest, the model will determine the optimal combination of tube voltage, tube current, exposure time per projection, workpiece orientation for conventional CT scanning geometries, and then expand the work towards nonconventional fast and adaptive CT scanning geometries to fit in with the work performed by other researchers in the project. The initial model will be developed based on simulated data, and then validated in experimental conditions using calibrated work pieces. The expected result is a validated model to determine the optimal set of exposure parameters that can be applied to any given work piece, including for nonconventional CT acquisition geometries. The research group has extensive prior experience with modelling CT acquisition parameters. Using stateoftheart simulation and image processing techniques, it is considered feasible to not only include the full set of available exposure parameters (incl. the scanning geometry) in a single model, but to do this in a taskspecific manner.

Our general understanding of these interfacial properties is still limited. How do solvent layers build up at nanoparticle surfaces in humid atmospheres and in dispersion? How does ligand coverage impact solvent layering? How do solvent layers in turn impact the diffusional mobility of water molecules on the surface? Recently, we shed light on the diffusion dynamics of water molecules on the surface of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and used isotopic exchange to differentiate the diffusion of citrate molecules from the one of water with quasielastic neutron scattering. In this project, this work shall be extended to nonmagnetic metal oxides. What we offer: The opportunity to work flexibly (in terms of location), e.g. from home.

ChinaComx investigates the intellectual, political, social, historical, and transcultural dimensions of a medium still heavily understudied:             lianhuanhua            , literally “linked images” 连环画. It studies them as a medium from the People’s Republic of China and its place within the larger Chinese and global comics culture. Studying the conditions of comic art’s production, distribution and consumption, the project sheds light on how comics contribute to the project of nation building, to the creation of a new socialist man and to the continued legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In addition, it investigates how these at times highly propagandistic texts were read by ordinary citizens. In providing more knowledge about comic culture from China and in contributing to theoretical debates,             ChinaComx             aims to delineate the term „            lianhuanhua            “ as a distinct genre and area of academic research that bears specific characteristics, being embedded in a particular context of origin, yet, changing across time and space as Japanese             manga             or FrancoBelgian             bandes desinnées            .

      "Textfeld des entfernten Eintrags: PhD position “Nuclear pore complex biogenesis” (f/m/d) Centre for Molecular Biology (ZMBH) Heidelberg University, Germany We are seeking a motivated PhD student with a background in biochemistry, cell biology or molecular biology. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large cylindrical structure with multiple copies of over 30 different proteins named nucleoporins (NUPs). The NPC is embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE) at fusion sites of the inner and outer nuclear membrane where it facilitates nuclearcytoplasmic transport of RNA and proteins. NPCs assemble in the intact nuclear envelope (interphase human cells or yeast cells with a closed mitosis) by an insideout mechanism. NUPs become deposited from within the nucleus to the inner nuclear membrane, deform this membrane and eventually the inner and outer nuclear membranes fuse. We recently have identified with Brr6 and Brl1 two conserved integral membrane proteins that may play a role in nuclear membrane fusion during NPC biogenesis. In this project we will study NPC biogenesis using budding yeast and human cells as model systems. The PhD student will use biochemical approaches (Brr6 and Brl1 reconstitution into liposomes), super resolution microscopy (MinFlux), electron microscopy, CRISPR/Cas9 technology and live cell imaging to study NPC assembly. Successful candidates will be part of an international team of PhD students and postdocs that works at the forefront of scientific research. The PhD student will be a member of the Heidelberg Biosciences International Graduate School (HBIGS) (            http://www.hbigs.uniheidelberg.de/ (http://www.hbigs.uniheidelberg.de/)            ).

Then the            Institute of Lung Health and Immunity            (LHI) at Helmholtz Munich, Germany is the ideal environment for you! Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a persistent respiratory disease marked by irreversible small airway obstruction, impacting over 400 million individuals globally. T cells play a pivotal role in COPD pathophysiology, correlating with lung tissue damage. Despite their significance, reliable T cellderived biomarkers for early COPD diagnosis remain elusive. To this end, the comprehensive phenotyping and the determination of T cell anatomical localization show promise in identifying clinically relevant subsets and understanding the functional dysregulation via major lung injury mechanisms. Additionally, the characterization of T cell repertoires throughout COPD progression could unveil evidence of potential immune tolerance breakdown in the lung.

This is what drives us. Why not join us and make a difference? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide fatal disease and is characterized by small airway obstruction, alveolar wall damage and chronic inflammation. Lung macrophages orchestrate the observed pathophysiology via the imbalance in the secretion of proinflammatory mediators and defects in macrophage phagocytosis which result in irreversible immune cell recruitment and emphysema. Moreover, macrophagederived reactive oxygen species predominate over endogenous antioxidant mechanisms and promote cellular senescence, mucous hypersecretion and contribute to the risk of acute exacerbations. Singlecell transcriptomics have revealed that lung macrophages are highly heterogeneous and comprise several molecular phenotypes. In COPD patients, one macrophage subset, called interstitial lung macrophages, is responsible for homeostatic processes, such as antigen presentation, the maintenance of arterial tone, wound healing and tissue repair. However, the phenotypic characterization of interstitial macrophages still remains incomplete. To elucidate their heterogeneity and functions over COPD progression, as well as to explore their potential as cellular biomarkers for early diagnosis, the            Kapellos lab            at the            Institute of Lung Health and Immunity            is seeking to hire a talented PhD candidate, starting ideally May 1, 2024.

The primary research goal of the Institute of Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) is the individualized prediction of diabetes risk and diabetes prevention and its personalized therapy. The institute is located in Tübingen. The Jumpertz Lab at the IDM focuses on translational research at the interface of the gut microbiome and metabolic diseases. We are looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher (f/m/x) to join the Jumpertz Lab. Globally more than 10% of the adult population has Diabetes, which is causally linked with numerous comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or tumor development, making it one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Therefore, our mission is to pursue a life without diabetes. Within the last two decades novel concepts of metabolic disease development and the gut microbiome, the trillion microbes colonizing our gut, have been highlighted and the Jumpertz Lab conducts translational research projects bridging clinical multicenter intervention studies in humans and basic research models using cutting edge techniques to metabolically phenotype humanized, gnotobiotic and germfree mouse models. Our focus is to understand how gut microbial communities affect host energy metabolism, glucose regulation and nutrient absorption.

      "Textfeld des entfernten Eintrags: The growing demand for energy transformation to counter the effects of climate change and reduce dependence on imported energy sources and raw materials is driving the European energy system towards a dynamic, supply- and demanddriven approach, often organized in local energy communities with a high penetration of renewable resources. Maintaining an efficient, sustainable, and stable energy supply requires the integration of various infrastructures, including electricity, gas, and heat sectors. However, the fluctuating availability of energy presents complex challenges for local energy communities. In particular, given the limited observability of the energy systems, advanced techniques are needed to model and estimate the behavior of the entire energy system in order to provide reliable data for system monitoring and control. We are currently seeking a PhD student for the following research topics: Data analysis considering uncertainties and related metrological aspects Development of the interfaces between monitoring devices and additional software tools Datadriven modeling of energy systems components for realtime and hardware in the loop (HiL) Development of advanced estimation algorithms for the energy grid Realtime implementation and hardwareintheloop validation of the methods and tools Integration of the developed algorithms in real applications\n",

Unser Profil The Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems at RWTH coordinates the InteroPEn Marie SkłodowskaCurie Action project. InteroPEn offers a unique doctoral training program for 10 researchers that integrates multisectorial knowledge, gathering electrical engineering and legal researchers. To achieve the common goal of the interoperable PEdominated power system, openness will be a pivotal factor across the different doctoral projects, tackling fundamental aspects of modern PEbased electrical systems such as control, protection, interoperability, governance, and intellectual property challenges. Comprised of 8 academic partners and 13 industrial associated partners, InteroPEn offers a broad industry and transmission system operator expertise for doctoral trainings, research, and secondments. Compared to previous EU projects and doctoral training networks on the interoperable PEdominated grid, InteroPEn is innovative by including two fundamental and new aspects: (1) the interplay of technical and legal perspectives is considered, and (2) openness principles are the heart of engineering and legal research, as well as training. The project will provide training through doctoral research to talented Doctoral Candidates. InterOpen Doctoral Candidates will enroll on PhD degree programmes and be employed for 36 months in a network of universities and industry with expertise in the field of power electronics, HVDC and modern power systems. Join us and work together with many national and international partners from industry and research to create a climatefriendly and secure future energy system! Ihr Profil The ideal candidate comes with the following profile: University degree (Master or equivalent) in Electrical Engineering (or similar), ideally with focus on power engineering or power electronics Interest in research and goal to achieve a doctoral degree Interest in HVDC and data models Innovative and interdisciplinary mindset, independent and structured way of working Fluent English, German is desirable but not mandatory Able to work in a team, good social and communication skills Due to mobility requirements of the MSCADN grant, the candidate may not have lived in Germany for 12 months or more during the 36 months before contract start date. Ihre Aufgaben The candidate hired for the position will perform research on the below doctoral project. During the project two secondments (each 36 months) at another university specialized in legal aspects, and an HVDC supplier are envisioned. In addition, the candidate will be responsible for smaller management tasks within the InteroPEn project, e.g., for dissemination. Doctoral Project: Structured Control &amp;amp; Protection Software for HVDC Converters To address climate change and energy independency, the EU aims for offshore energy generation of 340 Gigawatt by 2050. The most efficient way to transport this energy to shore is by using highvoltage directcurrent (HVDC) systems. Their behaviour is predominantly defined by the HVDC converter’s control and protection software. Several softwarerelated instabilities have been observed and could only be solved with detailed studies of the complete software and close collaboration between the involved parties. However, with the planned increase in HVDC systems, an easier approach is required. Ideally, the converter control and protection software could be sectioned into two parts, a lower level responsible for the power electronics / internal converter behaviour, and an upper level responsible for the power system / external converter behaviour. However, there are complex interdependencies of the respective software functions, hardware limitations, surrounding power system configuration, and intellectual property aspects. In this PhD project, we want to put order into the control and protection functions of HVDC converters. Based on an existing clustering tool that can sort control and protection functions into an upper layer and a lower layer software part (responsible for the external and internal converter behavior, respectively), we want to explore the possibilities using structured data – parts of which can be shared to achieve multivendor interoperability. Additionally, a new way of dependency analysis between control and protection functions (and their grouping) would be a useful outcome of this doctoral project.
